## Academic Projects 

### Employed and Poor? Wages, Automation and Policies 

- I explore the effect of automation on workers' welfare in a general equilibrium model. I demonstrate that the effects of capabilities and prices of automation on employment and wages are indeed different, and they depend on whether individuals adjust their education decisions. First, when education is not adjusted, my model shows that a decline in the price of automation increases the employment rate but lowers wages. Secondly, when education adjusts, I show that declining prices and expanding capabilities of automation increase both wages and employment rates. Finally, I find that between 2005 and 2016, advancement in automation rather than institutional changes or a shift to services accounts for a significant portion of changes in educational attainment, employment, and wage inequality.

### Capital Controls and the Global Financial Cycle <u><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3921294">[link]</a></u> (*with Johannes Matschke*)
- Capital flows to emerging markets are volatile and related to global financial conditions. In this paper, we examine the response of capital inflow controls to the global financial cycle. We make two contributions: First, we provide a normative justification for countercyclical capital inflow restrictions in response to international financial distress.We subsequently examine the factual response of 22 emerging market economies which actively manage their capital inflows. We find that restrictions tend to decrease during financial turmoil and vice versa, consistent with mitigating the exposure to international vulnerabilities.

### Innovation, Competition and Automation Exposure 
- I examine a choice of innovation strategy when firm faces two shocks simultaneously: a decline in automation prices and an increase in competitive pressure. Using the Community Innovation Survey and the Input-Output tables for European countries in the 2000-2014 period, I find that industry routine intensity is positively associated with firm engagement in innovating activities. Furthermore, in response to competition, firms in such industries are more likely to engage in product rather than process innovation. Exposure to low-wage countries through intermediate input does not impact innovation activities at the firm level.
